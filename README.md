## Description

The project consists of a simple React application that showcases how to use the React Context API to manage state across components without prop drilling. The main components of this application are:

For example:
- `App.js`: The root component of the application where the context provider is defined.
- `ComponentA.js` and `ComponentB.js`: These are two child components that consume the context provided by the `App` component.
- `Context.js`: This file defines the context and provides a state and a method to update the state to its children components.

## Usage of React Context API

- **Global State Management**: React Context API allows you to manage global state in your React application without having to pass props down manually through multiple levels of components.

- **Provider-Consumer Pattern**: It follows a provider-consumer pattern where a provider component wraps the subtree of components that need access to the context, and consumer components can consume the context values provided by the provider.

- **Avoids Prop Drilling**: Context API helps in avoiding prop drilling, which is the process of passing props through intermediate components that don't need them, by providing a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props manually at every level.

- **Multiple Contexts**: You can use multiple contexts in your application to organize and manage different parts of your application state separately.

- **Hooks Support**: React Context API is fully compatible with React Hooks, allowing you to consume context values using hooks like `useContext`.

- **Performance Considerations**: While Context API provides a convenient way to manage state globally, it's important to consider performance implications, especially when the context provider renders frequently or holds large amounts of data.
